      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Grant of Patent License.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(c)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(d)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="7.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                 any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE
                 text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

                 such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
              &lt;p&gt;You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or
                 different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
                 modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                 reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
                 in this License.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
          Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
             intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the
             terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
             Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate
             license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
          Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service
             marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use
             in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
          Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
             provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot;
             BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including,
             without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY,
             or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
             appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
             exercise of permissions under this License.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;
          Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
             negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
             grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for
             damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
             character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work
             (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
             malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
             been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;
          Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works
             thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
             indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
             in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
             responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
             defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
             against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
             liability.
        &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;/ul&gt;

For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

        <rdfs:comment>Ruby is disjunctively licensed project that allows the choice of this license and another. The other license choice has changed over time (from GPL originally, to BSD-2-Clause currently), so one needs to be aware of that change. The Ruby License itself is un-versioned, but has varied a bit over the years, the last substantive variation being in 2002.</rdfs:comment>

2. License Grants and Conditions
--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
    as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Grants

      Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Effective Date

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Limitations on Grant Scope

      The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(c)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.

      This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Subsequent Licenses

      No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Representation

      Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

   &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;-------------------

   &lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Distribution of Source Form

      All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Distribution of Executable Form

      If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Distribution of a Larger Work

      You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Notices

      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Application of Additional Terms

      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;---------------------------------------------------

   &lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Termination

   &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;--------------

   &lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.

This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

              Effective Date
                &lt;p&gt;The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective

              Limitations on Grant Scope
                &lt;p&gt;The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License.
                     No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or
                     licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b)
                     above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

                  for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

                     Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software
                     (except as part of its Contributor Version); or
                &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; (c)&lt;/var&gt;
                  under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.

&lt;/ul&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any

                     Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or
                     under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section

              Representation
                &lt;p&gt;Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its
                     original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its
                     Contributions conveyed by this License.

                &lt;p&gt;This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright

                     that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this

                     Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy
                     of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients&amp;apos;
                     rights in the Source Code Form.

              Distribution of Executable Form
                &lt;p&gt;If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;

                        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; (a)&lt;/var&gt;
                  such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in
                     Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain
                     a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no
                     more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
                &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; (b)&lt;/var&gt;
                  You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it
                     under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not
                     attempt to limit or alter the recipients&amp;apos; rights in the Source Code Form under
                     this License.
                &lt;/li&gt;

                  &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 3.3.&lt;/var&gt;
              Distribution of a Larger Work
                &lt;p&gt;You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that
                     You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If
                     the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one
                     or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With
                     Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such
                     Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the
                     recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
                     Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).

                     contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may
                     alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual
                     inaccuracies.

              Application of Additional Terms
                &lt;p&gt;You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
                     liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You
                     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must
                     make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability
                     obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every
                     Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of
                     warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include
                     additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
                     jurisdiction.
              &lt;/p&gt;

                 You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible;
                 and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be
                 placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under
                 this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such
                 description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able
                 to understand it.

              The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with
                 any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this
                 License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until
                 such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing
                 basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable
                 means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants
                 from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
                 notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You
                 have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You
                 become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 5.2.&lt;/var&gt;
              If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim
                 (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a
                 Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted
                 to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this
                 License shall terminate.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 5.3.&lt;/var&gt;
              In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements
                 (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your
                 distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.
            &lt;/li&gt;

                     other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of
                     this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

              Effect of New Versions
                &lt;p&gt;You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License
                     under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of
                     any subsequent version published by the license steward.

              Modified Versions

                     license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this
                     License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the
                     license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this
                     License).

&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt; CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="i.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="ii.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="iii.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="iv.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="v.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="vi.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="vii.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Limitations and Disclaimers.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="a.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="b.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="c.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="d.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;var;name="upstreamLink";original="";match="For more information, please see &lt;http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/&gt;"&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;</spdx:standardLicenseTemplate>

          Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law,
             Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons,
             and surrenders all of Affirmer&amp;apos;s Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and
             causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims

             including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the

             Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other

             or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent
             permitted taking into account Affirmer&amp;apos;s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to

    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
    LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
    HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
     in a Work;
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
     protection of databases, and under any national implementation
     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
     directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
     implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
    Work.
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
    this CC0 or use of the Work.

Version 2, June 1991

&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;&lt;var;name="incComma";original="";match=",|"&gt;&gt;

51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt; USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

&lt;&lt;var;name="termsTitle";original="";match="GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE|"&gt;&gt; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="0.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="c)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="c)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="7.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="10.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

   NO WARRANTY

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="11.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="12.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;one line to give the program's name and &lt;&lt;var;name="ideaArticle";original="an";match="a brief|an"&gt;&gt; idea of what it does.&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;

Copyright (C)&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;var;name="templateYear";original="yyyy";match="yyyy|year"&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;name of author&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt; USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt; This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.

    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Preamble
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
      to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
      intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
      make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
      License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation&amp;apos;s software
      and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other
      Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General
      Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
      Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
      the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
      this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get
      it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of
      it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
      anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
      rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
      you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
      or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you
      have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
      code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the
      software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
      permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Also, for each author&amp;apos;s protection and ours, we want to make
      certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for
      this free software. If the software is modified by someone else
      and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they
      have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
      others will not reflect on the original authors&amp;apos; reputations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
      We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program
      will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
      proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
      must be licensed for everyone&amp;apos;s free use or not licensed at all.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      The precise terms and conditions for copying,
      distribution and modification follow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; &lt;/var&gt;
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 0.&lt;/var&gt;
        This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
        notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
        under the terms of this General Public License. The &amp;quot;Program&amp;quot;, below,
        refers to any such program or work, and a &amp;quot;work based on the Program&amp;quot;
        means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
        that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
        either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
        language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation
        in the term &amp;quot;modification&amp;quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;.
        &lt;p&gt;
          Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
          not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act
          of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
          Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
          on the Program (independent of having been made by running the
          Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
        You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&amp;apos;s source
        code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
        and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
        and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
        this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
        recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
        &lt;p&gt;
          You may charge a fee for the physical act of
          transferring a copy, and you may at your option
          offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
        You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
        of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
        distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section
        1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
        
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
            stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,
            that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
            Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no
            charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
            If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
            when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
            interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
            an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
            a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
            provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program
            under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
            of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive
            but does not normally print such an announcement, your work
            based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
          identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
          Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
          works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
          apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
          works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
          whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution
          of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
          permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,
          and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
          contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,
          the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution
          of derivative or collective works based on the Program.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on
          the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the
          Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does
          not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
        You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
        under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
        Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
        
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
            code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and
            2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
            years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
            cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
            machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to
            be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
            on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
            Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
            to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative
            is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if
            you received the program in object code or executable form
            with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work
          for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete
          source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
          plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
          used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
          However, as a special exception, the source code distributed
          need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
          source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
          kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
          runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
          access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
          access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
          distribution of the source code, even though third parties are
          not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
        You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
        except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
        otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program
        is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
        this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
        rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
        terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
        You are not required to accept this License, since you have
        not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to
        modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These
        actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
        Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any
        work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
        License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
        distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
        Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
        Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
        original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
        these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
        on the recipients&amp;apos; exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
        responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
        If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
        infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
        conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
        or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,
        they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you
        cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations
        under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
        consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example,
        if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of
        the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
        through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
        License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
        &lt;p&gt;
          If any portion of this section is held invalid or
          unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the
          balance of the section is intended to apply and the section
          as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
          any patents or other property right claims or to contest
          validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose
          of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
          system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
          people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
          software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
          application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to
          decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through
          any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
          believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;
        If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
        certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
        the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
        License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
        excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
        in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License
        incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;
        The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
        versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such
        new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
        but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
        &lt;p&gt;
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
          Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
          to it and &amp;quot;any later version&amp;quot;, you have the option of following
          the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
          version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program
          does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
          any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;
        If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
        programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
        author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
        Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
        sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
        two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
        software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
        &lt;p&gt;
          NO WARRANTY
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 11.&lt;/var&gt;
        BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
        FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT
        WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
        PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
        EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
        IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
        THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
        ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 12.&lt;/var&gt;
        IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
        WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
        REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
        DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
        DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
        (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
        INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
        THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
        OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
      &lt;/li&gt;
    
&lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;div class="optional-license-text"&gt; 
      &lt;p&gt;
        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If you develop a new program, and you want it to be
        of the greatest possible use to the public, the best
        way to achieve this is to make it free software which
        everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
        to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
        convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
        the &amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;var class="optional-license-text"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/var&gt;one line to give the program&amp;apos;s name and &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; an&lt;/var&gt; idea of what it does.&lt;var class="optional-license-text"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/var&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;

        Copyright (C)
        &lt;var class="optional-license-text"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; yyyy&lt;/var&gt;&lt;var class="optional-license-text"&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/var&gt;
        &lt;var class="optional-license-text"&gt; &amp;lt;&lt;/var&gt;name of author&lt;var class="optional-license-text"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/var&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
        modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License

        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be
        useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied

      &lt;p&gt;
        Also add information on how to
        contact you by electronic and paper mail.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If the program is interactive, make it output a short
        notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        The hypothetical commands `show w&amp;apos; and `show c&amp;apos; should show the
        appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
        you use may be called something other than `show w&amp;apos; and `show c&amp;apos;; they
        could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)
        or your school, if any, to sign a &amp;quot;copyright disclaimer&amp;quot; for
        the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

      &lt;p&gt;
        This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
        proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
        consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
        library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
        Public License instead of this License.

Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does. Copyright (C) yyyy name of author

     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

Version 3, 29 June 2007

&lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="0.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Definitions.

   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Source Code.

   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Basic Permissions.

   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Conveying Verbatim Copies.

   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Conveying Modified Source Versions.

   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="c)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="d)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Conveying Non-Source Forms.

   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="c)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="d)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="e)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="7.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Additional Terms.

   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="c)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="d)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="e)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="f)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Termination.

   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="10.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="11.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Patents.

   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="12.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="13.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="14.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Revised Versions of this License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

&lt;&lt;var;name="description";original="&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;";match=".+"&gt;&gt;

Copyright (C) &lt;&lt;var;name="copyright";original="&lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;";match=".+"&gt;&gt;

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

&lt;program&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;

This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.

This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.

        <spdx:licenseText>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.
The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.

A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.

     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.
“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or

     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents.
A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.

A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read &lt;https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&lt;br /&gt;

        Version 3, 29 June 2007
      &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
      &amp;lt;https://fsf.org/&amp;gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Preamble
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft
      license for software and other kinds of works.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to
      take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU
      General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
      change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software
      for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General
      Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work
      released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
      price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
      have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
      for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
      if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of
      it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
      these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
      certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or
      if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
      or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
      you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
      source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
      (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
      giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      For the developers&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; protection, the GPL clearly
      explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For
      both users&amp;apos; and authors&amp;apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified
      versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will
      not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
      versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can
      do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting
      users&amp;apos; freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of
      such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use,
      which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have
      designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
      products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains,
      we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future
      versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
      States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
      software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish
      to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program
      could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL
      assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      The precise terms and conditions for copying,
      distribution and modification follow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 0.&lt;/var&gt;
        Definitions.
        &lt;p&gt;
          &amp;quot;This License&amp;quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          &amp;quot;Copyright&amp;quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply
          to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          &amp;quot;The Program&amp;quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
          this License. Each licensee is addressed as &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Licensees&amp;quot;
          and &amp;quot;recipients&amp;quot; may be individuals or organizations.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          To &amp;quot;modify&amp;quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
          work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
          making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a &amp;quot;modified
          version&amp;quot; of the earlier work or a work &amp;quot;based on&amp;quot; the earlier work.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          A &amp;quot;covered work&amp;quot; means either the unmodified
          Program or a work based on the Program.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          To &amp;quot;propagate&amp;quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without
          permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
          infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it
          on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes
          copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available
          to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          To &amp;quot;convey&amp;quot; a work means any kind of propagation
          that enables other parties to make or receive copies.
          Mere interaction with a user through a computer
          network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          An interactive user interface displays &amp;quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&amp;quot;
          to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
          feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
          tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
          the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey
          the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.
          If the interface presents a list of user commands or options,
          such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
        Source Code.&lt;br /&gt;

        The &amp;quot;source code&amp;quot; for a work means the preferred
        form of the work for making modifications to it.
        &amp;quot;Object code&amp;quot; means any non-source form of a work.
        &lt;p&gt;
          A &amp;quot;Standard Interface&amp;quot; means an interface that either is an official
          standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case
          of interfaces specified for a particular programming language,
          one that is widely used among developers working in that language.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The &amp;quot;System Libraries&amp;quot; of an executable work include anything, other
          than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form
          of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
          Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
          Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
          implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
          &amp;quot;Major Component&amp;quot;, in this context, means a major essential component
          (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
          (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
          produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The &amp;quot;Corresponding Source&amp;quot; for a work in object code form means all
          the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
          work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
          to control those activities. However, it does not include the work&amp;apos;s
          System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available
          free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities
          but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding
          Source includes interface definition files associated with source
          files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries
          and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically
          designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or
          control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
          regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The Corresponding Source for a work
          in source code form is that same work.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
        Basic Permissions.&lt;br /&gt;

        All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
        copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
        conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
        permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
        covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
        content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
        rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
        &lt;p&gt;
          You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
          without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
          You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
          them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
          facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
          the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
          not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works
          for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
          and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies
          of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted
          solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing
          is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
        Protecting Users&amp;apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&lt;br /&gt;

        No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
        measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
        11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
        similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.
        &lt;p&gt;
          When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to
          forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent
          such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this
          License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any
          intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means
          of enforcing, against the work&amp;apos;s users, your or third parties&amp;apos;
          legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
        Conveying Verbatim Copies.&lt;br /&gt;

        You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&amp;apos;s source code as
        you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
        and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright
        notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
        non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
        code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
        give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
        &lt;p&gt;
          You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you
          convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
        Conveying Modified Source Versions.&lt;br /&gt;

        You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
        produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
        of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
        
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            The work must carry prominent notices stating
            that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            The work must carry prominent notices stating that
            it is released under this License and any conditions
            added under section 7. This requirement modifies the
            requirement in section 4 to &amp;quot;keep intact all notices&amp;quot;.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
            You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
            to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License
            will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
            additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
            regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
            permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
            invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
            If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must
            display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program
            has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate
            Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
          works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
          work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
          program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium,
          is called an &amp;quot;aggregate&amp;quot; if the compilation and its resulting
          copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights
          of the compilation&amp;apos;s users beyond what the individual works
          permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not
          cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
        Conveying Non-Source Forms.&lt;br /&gt;

        You may convey a covered work in object code form
        under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you
        also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source
        under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:
        
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical
            product (including a physical distribution medium),
            accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable
            physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
            (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
            written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for
            as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
            product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
            either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software
            in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable
            physical medium customarily used for software interchange,
            for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically
            performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy
            the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
            Convey individual copies of the object code with a
            copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding
            Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally
            and noncommercially, and only if you received the object
            code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
            Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
            (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
            Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at
            no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
            Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place
            to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding
            Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third
            party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you
            maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where
            to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts
            the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it
            is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;
            Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
            provided you inform other peers where the object code
            and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered
            to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
          excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library,
          need not be included in conveying the object code work.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          A &amp;quot;User Product&amp;quot; is either (1) a &amp;quot;consumer product&amp;quot;, which means
          any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
          family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold
          for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product
          is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor
          of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular
          user, &amp;quot;normally used&amp;quot; refers to a typical or common use of that
          class of product, regardless of the status of the particular
          user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,
          or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a
          consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
          commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses
          represent the only significant mode of use of the product.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          &amp;quot;Installation Information&amp;quot; for a User Product means any methods,
          procedures, authorization keys, or other information required
          to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in
          that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding
          Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
          functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented
          or interfered with solely because modification has been made.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
          or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
          occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession
          and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
          perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
          is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this
          section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.
          But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third
          party retains the ability to install modified object code on the
          User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
          include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
          warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified
          or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in
          which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network
          may be denied when the modification itself materially and
          adversely affects the operation of the network or violates
          the rules and protocols for communication across the network.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
          provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that
          is publicly documented (and with an implementation available
          to the public in source code form), and must require no
          special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
        Additional Terms.&lt;br /&gt;

        &amp;quot;Additional permissions&amp;quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this
        License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
        Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program
        shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to
        the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional
        permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used
        separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains
        governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.
        &lt;p&gt;
          When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
          remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
          of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
          removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place
          additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
          for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
          add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
          of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
        &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
            Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently
            from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
            Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal
            notices or author attributions in that material or in the
            Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
            Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
            or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked
            in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
            Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names
            of licensors or authors of the material; or
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;
            Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use
            of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
          &lt;/li&gt;
          
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; f)&lt;/var&gt;
            Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
            material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
            versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability
            to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
            assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &amp;quot;further
          restrictions&amp;quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program
          as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating
          that it is governed by this License along with a term that is
          a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license
          document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or
          conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material
          governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the
          further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this
          section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a
          statement of the additional terms that apply to those files,
          or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be
          stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated
          as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;
        Termination.&lt;br /&gt;

        You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as
        expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
        to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically
        terminate your rights under this License (including any patent
        licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).
        &lt;p&gt;
          However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
          license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
          provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
          and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if
          the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by
          some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
          reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you
          of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first
          time you have received notice of violation of this License
          (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the
          violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Termination of your rights under this section does not
          terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or
          rights from you under this License. If your rights have been
          terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify
          to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;
        Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&lt;br /&gt;

        You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
        run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
        occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
        to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
        nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate
        or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you
        do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
        covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;
        Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&lt;br /&gt;

        Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
        receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
        propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
        for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
        &lt;p&gt;
          An &amp;quot;entity transaction&amp;quot; is a transaction transferring control of
          an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing
          an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a
          covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
          transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
          licenses to the work the party&amp;apos;s predecessor in interest had or could
          give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
          Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest,
          if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
          rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you
          may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise
          of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
          litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
          alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,
          offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 11.&lt;/var&gt;
        Patents.&lt;br /&gt;

        A &amp;quot;contributor&amp;quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
        License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
        work thus licensed is called the contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;contributor version&amp;quot;.
        &lt;p&gt;
          A contributor&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;essential patent claims&amp;quot; are all patent
          claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already
          acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some
          manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling
          its contributor version, but do not include claims that would
          be infringed only as a consequence of further modification
          of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,
          &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in
          a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
          patent license under the contributor&amp;apos;s essential patent claims,
          to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,
          modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          In the following three paragraphs, a &amp;quot;patent license&amp;quot; is any
          express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
          enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice
          a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To
          &amp;quot;grant&amp;quot; such a patent license to a party means to make such an
          agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
          and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
          to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through
          a publicly available network server or other readily accessible
          means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to
          be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit
          of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in
          a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend
          the patent license to downstream recipients. &amp;quot;Knowingly relying&amp;quot;
          means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your
          conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient&amp;apos;s use of
          the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable
          patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
          arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance
          of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the
          parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,
          propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,
          then the patent license you grant is automatically extended
          to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          A patent license is &amp;quot;discriminatory&amp;quot; if it does not include within the
          scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned
          on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
          granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if
          you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the
          business of distributing software, under which you make payment to
          the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
          the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
          parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
          patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
          conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
          for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
          contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
          or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or
          limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement
          that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 12.&lt;/var&gt;
        No Surrender of Others&amp;apos; Freedom.&lt;br /&gt;

        If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
        or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,
        they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If
        you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously
        your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
        obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.
        For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect
        a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the
        Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
        License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 13.&lt;/var&gt;
        Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&lt;br /&gt;

        Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
        permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
        under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into
        a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The
        terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which
        is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU
        Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction
        through a network will apply to the combination as such.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 14.&lt;/var&gt;
        Revised Versions of this License.&lt;br /&gt;

        The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
        versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such
        new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
        but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
        &lt;p&gt;
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
          Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
          General Public License &amp;quot;or any later version&amp;quot; applies to it,
          you have the option of following the terms and conditions either
          of that numbered version or of any later version published by
          the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a
          version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose
          any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
          versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
          proxy&amp;apos;s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
          authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          Later license versions may give you additional or
          different permissions. However, no additional obligations
          are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a
          result of your choosing to follow a later version.
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 15.&lt;/var&gt;
        Disclaimer of Warranty.&lt;br /&gt;

        THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
        APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
        HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; WITHOUT
        WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
        LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
        A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
        OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
        ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 16.&lt;/var&gt;
        Limitation of Liability.&lt;br /&gt;

        IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
        WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
        CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
        INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
        ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING
        BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
        OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
        PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
        OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;li&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; 17.&lt;/var&gt;
        Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
    &lt;p&gt;
      If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability
      provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to
      their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most
      closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
      connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
      liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
    
&lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;div class="optional-license-text"&gt; 
      &lt;p&gt;
        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If you develop a new program, and you want it to be
        of the greatest possible use to the public, the best
        way to achieve this is to make it free software which
        everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
        to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
        state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
        the &amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; &amp;lt;one line to give the program&amp;apos;s name and
        a brief idea of what it does.&amp;gt;&lt;/var&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

        Copyright (C) &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; &amp;lt;year&amp;gt; &amp;lt;name of author&amp;gt;&lt;/var&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or
        modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
        as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version
        3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be
        useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied
        warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        You should have received a copy of the GNU General
	Public License along with this program. If not, see
	&amp;lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&amp;gt;.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a
        short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
	&amp;lt;program&amp;gt; Copyright (C) &amp;lt;year&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;name of author&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;

        This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO
        WARRANTY; for details type `show w&amp;apos;.&lt;br /&gt;

        This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
        it under certain conditions; type `show c&amp;apos; for details.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        The hypothetical commands `show w&amp;apos; and `show c&amp;apos; should
        show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.
        Of course, your program&amp;apos;s commands might be different;
        for a GUI interface, you would use an &amp;quot;about box&amp;quot;.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        You should also get your employer (if you work as a
        programmer) or school, if any, to sign a &amp;quot;copyright disclaimer&amp;quot;
        for the program, if necessary. For more information on
	this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
	&amp;lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&amp;gt;.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
        The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating
        your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a
        subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit
        linking proprietary applications with the library. If this
        is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public
	License instead of this License. But first, please read
	&amp;lt;https:&lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt; //www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html&amp;gt;.&lt;/var&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
