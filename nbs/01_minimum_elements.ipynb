    "1. Frequence - a new SBOM must be created upon version updates or error correction\n",
    "2. Depth - a SBOM should contain all primary components with transitive dependencies listed.  At a minimum all dependencies must be listed with enough detail to seek recursive transitive dependencies.  \n",
    "3. Known Unknowns - in cases when a full dependency graph is unable to be enumerated, a SBOM must explicitly identify \"known uknowns\".  Futhermore the author should affirmatively state when all direct dependencies of a component have been fully enumerated, or when there are no further cdependencies.\n",
    "4. Distribution and Delivery - SBOMs should be available in a timely fassion to those who need them and must have appropriate access permissions in place\n",
    "5. Access Control - if access control is desired, the terms for integrading SBOM datta to a user's security tools must be specified\n",
    "6. Accommadation of Mistakes - should be built into the initial phase of SBOM, allowing for omissions and errors."
