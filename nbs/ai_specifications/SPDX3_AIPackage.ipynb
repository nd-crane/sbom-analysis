    "### energy_consumption \n",
    "- **SPDX3:** `energy_consumption` captures the amount of energy needed to train and operate the AI model. This value is also known as training energy consumption or inference energy consumption.\n",

    "\n",
    "### standardCompliance\n",
    "- **SPDX3:** `StandardCompliance` captures a standard that the AI software complies with. This includes both published and unpublished standards, for example ISO, IEEE, ETSI etc. The standard could (but not necessarily have to) be used to satisfy a legal or regulatory requirement.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Limitation\n",
    "- **SPDX3:** `limitation` captures a limitation of the AI Package (or of the AI models present in the AI package), expressed as free form text. Note that this is not guaranteed to be exhaustive. For instance, a limitation might be that the AI package cannot be used on datasets from a certain demography.\n",
    "- **HFMC:** `bias_risks_limitations`. This section identifies foreseeable harms, misunderstandings, and technical and sociotechnical limitations. It also provides information on warnings and potential mitigations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TypeOfModel\n",
    "- **SPDX3:** `typeOfModel` records the type of the AI model(s) used in the software. For instance, if it is a supervised model, unsupervised model, reinforcement learning model or a combination of those.\n",
    "- **HFMC:** `model_description:model_type` You can name the “type” as Supervision/Learning Method, Machine Learning Type, and Modality.\n",

    "- **HFMC:** `finetuned_from` If this model has another model as its base, link to that model here.\n",
    "- **HFMC:** `Training Details` is a section that provides information to describe and replicate training, including the training data, the speed and size of training elements, and the environmental impact of training. This relates heavily to the Technical Specifications as well, and content here should link to that section when it is relevant to the training procedure. It is useful for people who want to learn more about the model inputs and training footprint. It is relevant for anyone who wants to know the basics of what the model is learning. Some keys related to training  can be used in the metadata YAML section:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `training_data` Write 1-2 sentences on what the training data is. Ideally this links to a Dataset Card for further information. Links to documentation related to data pre-processing or additional filtering may go here as well as in More Information.\n",

    "- **HFMC:** None\n",
    "  \n",
    "###  metricDecisionThreshold\n",
    "- **SPDX3:** `metricDecisionThreshold` Each metric might be computed based on a decision threshold. For instance, precision or recall is typically computed by checking if the probability of the outcome is larger than 0.5. Each decision threshold should match with a metric field defined in the AI Package.\n",
    "- **HFMC:** None\n",
    "  \n",
    "###  metric\n",
    "- **SPDX3:** `metric` Metric records the measurement with which the AI model was evaluated. This makes statements about the prediction quality including uncertainty, accuracy, characteristics of the tested population, quality, fairness, explainability, robustness etc.\n",
