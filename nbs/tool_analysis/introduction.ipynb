    "## Brief overview \n",
    "\n",
    "This section analyses some SBOM generation tools available in the market. The study is based on the [fossa](https://fossa.com/blog/framework-evaluating-sbom-tools/) framework for Evaluating SBOM Tools, on the [NTIA minimum element guidelines](https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/sbom_minimum_elements_report.pdf), and in some quality metrics for SBOMs available in the [sbomqs](https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbomqs) tool. We also analyzed the SBOMs generated through knowledge graphs.\n",

    "## Tools overall analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the features we used to analyze the SBOM generation tools were based on the framework for Evaluating SBOM Tools in [fossa](https://fossa.com/blog/framework-evaluating-sbom-tools/), such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What standards it supports (SPDX, Cyclone DX)\n",
    "- Compliance with the Cyber Security Executive Order\n",
    "- Data Field Coverage\n",
    "- Automation Support\n",
    "- Programming Language Support\n",
    "- Dependency Recognition Depth\n",
    "\n",
    "We classified the tools following the [SBOM Tool Classification Taxonomy](https://www.ntia.gov/files/ntia/publications/ntia_sbom_tooling_taxonomy-2021mar30.pdf) document by the NTIA SBOM Formats & Tooling Working Group.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Quality metrics to assess the generated SBOMs\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluated the performance of the tools by examining the quality of the SBOMs they produced for some case studies projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Case Study 1](./cs1/overall_analysis.ipynb): The target is the [PyTorch repo](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)\n",
    "- [Case Study 2](./cs2/overall_analysis.ipynb): The target is the [TheBloke/text-generation-webui repo](https://github.com/TheBloke/text-generation-webui)\n",
    "\n",
    "The SBOMs generated by the tools were analyzed using the [sbomqs](https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbomqs) tool.\n",
    "The analysis results can be found on the pages dedicated to each case study.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation of SBOMs involves five categories in the scoring system, **NTIA-minimum-elements**, **Structural**, **Semantic**, **Quality**, and **Sharing**. The score is calculated based on the number of elements in each category, and the higher the score, the more consumable the SBOMs should be. More details about the sbomqs SBOM quality check can be found [here](https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbomqs/blob/main/Features.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following table shows the features used to calculate each category's score.\n",
