    "## Brief overview \n",
    "\n",
    "This section contains the analysis of some SBOMs generation tools available in the market. The analysis is based on the [fossa](https://fossa.com/blog/framework-evaluating-sbom-tools/) framework for Evaluating SBOM Tools, on the [NTIA minimum element guidelines](https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/sbom_minimum_elements_report.pdf), and in some quality metrics for SBOMs available in the [sbomqs](https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbomqs) tool. We also analyzed the SBOMs generated through knowledge graphs.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Tools overall analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the features we used to analize the SBOM generation tools were based on the framework for Evaluating SBOM Tools in [fossa](https://fossa.com/blog/framework-evaluating-sbom-tools/), such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What standards it supports (SPDX, Cyclone DX)\n",
    "- Compliance with the Cyber Security Executive Order\n",
    "- Data Field Coverage\n",
    "- Automation Support\n",
    "- Programming Language Support\n",
    "- Dependency Recognition Depth\n",
    "\n",
    "We classified the tools following the [SBOM Tool Classification Taxonomy](https://www.ntia.gov/files/ntia/publications/ntia_sbom_tooling_taxonomy-2021mar30.pdf) document by the NTIA SBOM Formats & Tooling Working Group.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SBOM generation tools we analyzed are listed below, and their overall analysis can be found [here](./tools_overall_analysis.qmd).\n",

    "## Quality metrics to assess the generated SBOMs\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluated the performance of the tools by examining the quality of the SBOMs they produced for some case studies projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Case Study 1](./case_study_1.qmd)\n",
    "- [Case Study 2](./case_study_2.qmd)\n",
    "\n",
    "The SBOMs generated by the tools were analyzed using the [sbomqs](https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbomqs) tool.\n",
    "You can find the analysis results on the case studies page.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation of SBOMs involves 5 different categories in the scoring system, **NTIA-minimum-elements**, **Structural**, **Semantic**, **Quality**, and **Sharing**. The score is calculated based on the number of elements in each category and the higher the score the more consumable the SBOMs should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following table shows the features that are used to calculate the score for each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NTIA-minimum-elements\n",
    "Includes features, which help you understand if your sbom's comply with NTIA minimum element guidelines.\n",
